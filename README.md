Here's what the .CSV information looks like:

Yahoo will only let you download the stock information for one stock at a time on their site, but you can download multiple stocks at the same time with this app.  You can get the data in daily, weekly, or monthly format and then analyze it at your convenience.

This was built for .NET 4 so it will work on Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10 as long as .NET 4 is installed.

To get this working, clone this project and open the YahooDownloader.sln file in this folder inside of Visual Studio:
```
YahooFinanceQuoteDownloader/Complete Versions/Asynchronous Version
```

If you run it in Visual Studio it should work, if not send me an email.
