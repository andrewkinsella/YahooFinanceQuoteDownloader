Yahoo will only let you download the stock information for one stock at a time on their site, but you can download multiple stocks at the same time with this program.

This was built with Visual Studio 2013, I included all the files in the solution folder.  It is built for .NET 4 so it will work on Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8 as long as .NET 4 is installed.
