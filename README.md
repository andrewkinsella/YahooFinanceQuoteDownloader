If you want to run the .exe without compiling the source code it's here:
```
YahooDownloader/bin/Debug/YahooDownloader.exe
```
Yahoo will only let you download the stock information for one stock at a time on their site, but you can download multiple stocks at the same time with this app.  You can get the data in daily, weekly, or monthly format and then analyze it at your convenience.

This was built for .NET 4 so it will work on Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10 as long as .NET 4 is installed.
